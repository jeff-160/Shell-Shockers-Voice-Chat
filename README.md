## Introduction
This program uses Selenium to inject a custom script into the Shell Shockers webpage to interact with it, and uses the Google speech recognition API to send speech inputs into the chat.  

Speech inputs are further converted into a custom font to bypass the chat filters in Shell Shockers.

## Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
